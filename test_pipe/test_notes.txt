This test is designed to briefly runthrough an analysis of CUT&RUN data 
to test all components. This is not the recommended way of setting up a
run, as several preparation steps have been truncated to fit into the
timeframe of the Travis-CI automated testing.

The SeqKit software package is also utilized here to subsample the reads 
from the provided dataset, but is not listed as an "official" dependency
of CUT&RUN-Flow.
